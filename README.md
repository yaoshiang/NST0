Implementation of NST0 color shifting algorithm.

You might find this repo interesting if you are interested in:

* How I implemented the tool hosted at [https://yaoshiang.com/tool_nst0.html](https://yaoshiang.com/tool_nst0.html)
* How to export a PyTorch model to onnx
* How to call that model from an HTML webpage (this took the longest due to weak [documentation about ONNX Runtime for Web](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/).
